      Ever since I was a child, I always had a wide range of interests and
      enjoyed learning new things, but it still took me a while to find out what
      I really want to do in my life. I was probably around 15 or 16, when
      suddenly something clicked in my head.
      <i>What if I could make computer games?</i> I had always enjoyed playing
      them, starting from when I was very little and was sitting at my mum's old
      PC, solving puzzle games, up to getting a proper computer on my own when I
      was older, and exploring various genres. Some of my favourite titles these
      days are <i>Medieval Dynasty</i>, <i>Stellaris</i>,
      <i>Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic II</i> and
      <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i>. I love diving into those fictional worlds
      and exploring lives different from my own for a while. There are so many
      things that I would love to learn and do, that it is probably too much for
      one lifetime, but with games I have the opportunity to experience at least
      a fraction of it in a way.

      One of the first crucial steps to getting closer to my dream was finding
      an appropriate educational programme that would teach me the necessary
      skills. I finally came across the bachelor programme Creative Computing,
      and was very happy when I received the info that my application for it got
      accepted and I would be able to start studying in September 2021. I have
      learned many new things since then, and it even opened the doors to new
      interests for me, like web or mobile development.

      However, I did not want to rely only on the things I would learn through
      formal education. I already started with self-studying when I was still at
      school, I bought books about programming and followed 3D modelling
      tutorials that I found online. A major reason why these things - among
      others - fascinate me, is that they allow me to take seemingly nothing and
      create something from it. I start out with a simple cube or sphere in my
      3D programme, but I could make an actual object or character from it. Or I
      write some lines of code, and suddenly things move on the screen or react
      to user input. This ability of just creating something out my own skills
      and knowledge is something that I have really come to love. Sure, at times
      it could be intimidating as well, for example because it seemed like I
      would need all those fancy and expensive tools and programs, but I was,
      and still am, determined to achieve my goals regardless. To me, a skill
      that I do not have is usually just one that I have not learned yet. As
      mentioned previously, I love learning new things, and I hope to soon find
      the (work)place that is right for me to bring in my skills.
