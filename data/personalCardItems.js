      'In October 2022 I wanted to get back into practising 3D modelling again after not finding any time for it for a while, and I decided to recreate the medallion from "Pirates of the Caribbean" by using Blender. It is probably the most detailed 3D object I created so far and I learned a lot during the process. I focused mainly on the modelling part here, but I would love do some proper texturing on it as well.',
