      "I made this simple 3D adventure game for my Unity class in the 4th semester (SS 2023). The main task was to make a small playable game with at least two levels (excluding menus), the topic was free to choose. For the final assignment in my 3D modelling class, I had made a little FunkoPop replica of Captain Barbossa from 'Pirates of the Caribbean', so I thought I could use him as the player character for this project as well and made another pirate-themed game. I just had to add some animations to the model. Most other assets in the game are made by me as well (except the ship and environment textures), though overall I focused more on the coding and Unity scene setup, as that was the main focus of the project.",

      "This 3D adventure game was the final project in my 4th semester (SS 2023) and was done as a group project with three of my study colleagues. I was responsible for creating our main character with all of their features (concept, modelling, texturing, rigging, animating), as well as some other graphical assets, both 2D and 3D, like the treasure chest or the inventory. However, I also participated in coding the game. Some of the enviroment assets used are from the Unity asset store, music and sound effects are free samples from SoundQ, everything else was made by us. The audio implementation was done with Wwise (a project requirement), however this is unfortunately also the reason I can't provide a direct link to the game, as the implementation didn't allow a WebGL build. However, you can find the Windows executable in the game's GitHub repository.",

      "I made this simple platformer game for my 2D Game Animation course during the 3rd and 4th semester (WS 2022/SS 2023). The first part of the course was to design our main character and rig and animate them in Spine 2D. The second part consisted of programming the game in Unity, with a special focus on how to use the engine to make 2D games. All assets except the background music (taken from freesfx.co.uk) were made by myself.",

      "I designed and developed this Android app (written in Kotlin) together with a study colleague in the context of our 3rd semester end project (WS 2022), whose main focus was mobile development and design. In this app, users can upload images of their favourite fictional characters, and then get randomised positive affirmations along with one of the images, to help with feelings like stress and anxiety. I was responsible for the main part of the programming, the design was done collaboratively with my colleague. A UX evaluation was done as well on the app's prototype.",

      "This was my final project for my JavaScript course in the 3rd semester (WS 2022), which was centered mainly around JS frameworks like Vue and Nuxt. The task was to create a simple game of our choice by applying the knowledge we got throughout the course. I decided to make a small memory game, thematically inspired by the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.",

      "This was my UI design final project for the 3rd semester (WS 2022), focusing on mobile design in particular. Out of the given design briefs, I chose to design an app that combines existing video streaming services, to unite their best features and make the management of their subscriptions easier for users. The goal of the project was to go through a complete design journey, from sketches and wireframes to design systems, high fidelity designs and an interactable prototype.",

      "For the end project of my 2nd semester (SS 2022), which focused on full-stack web development, I created a simple website for sharing art. It was developed by using Node.js and a MySQL database. Everything, including the code, website design, as well as the example drawings, was made by me. In the finished project, users could sign up and log in, edit or delete their profiles, as well as post and delete pictures. Unfortunately, the database that was provided for the project by the university is not that reliable, and the attempt to host it keeps causing issues, so I cannot show the site directly at the moment.",

The goal was to develop a consistent design for both desktop and mobile view. The course was my first introduction to UI design and to using the software Figma, and covered the most important concepts such as wireframing, low and high fidelity designs, design systems and simple prototypes.",

Music and sound effects were taken from freesfx.co.uk, everything else (story, graphics, code) was made by me. I kept the graphics rather simple due to time limitation, but it was a great opportunity to learn more about JavaScript and OOP.",
