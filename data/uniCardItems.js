      "I designed and developed this Android app (written in Kotlin) together with a study colleague in the context of our third semester end project (WS 2022), whose main focus was mobile development and design. In this app, users can upload images of their favourite fictional characters, and then get randomised positive affirmations along with one of the images, to help with feelings like stress and anxiety. I was responsible for the main part of the programming, the design was done collaboratively with my colleague. A UX evaluation was done as well on the app's prototype.",

      "This was my final project for my JavaScript course in the third semester (WS 2022), which was centered mainly around JS frameworks like Vue and Nuxt. The task was to create a simple game of our choice by applying the knowledge we got throughout the course. I decided to make a small memory game, thematically inspired by the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.",

      "This was my UI design final project for the third semester (WS 2022), focusing on mobile design in particular. Out of the given design briefs, I chose to design an app that combines existing video streaming services, to unite their best features and make the management of their subscriptions easier for users. The goal of the project was to go through a complete design journey, from sketches and wireframes to design systems, high fidelity designs and an interactable prototype.",

      "For the end project of my second semester (SS 2022), which focused on full-stack web development, I created a simple website for sharing art. It was developed by using Node.js and a MySQL database. Everything, including the code, website design, as well as the example drawings, was made by me. In the finished project, users could sign up and log in, edit or delete their profiles, as well as post and delete pictures. Unfortunately, the database that was provided for the project by the university is not that reliable, and the attempt to host it keeps causing issues, so I cannot show the site directly at the moment.",

      "For my course project on responsive web design in the second semester (SS 2022), I had to design a basic online banking application. The goal was to develop a consistent design for both desktop and mobile view. The course was my first introduction to UI design and to using the software Figma, and covered the most important concepts such as wireframing, low and high fidelity designs, design systems and simple prototypes.",

      "One of my projects from the first semester (WS 2021), a simple browsergame written in JavaScript. Music and sound effects were taken from freesfx.co.uk, everything else (story, graphics, code) was made by me. I kept the graphics rather simple due to time limitation, but it was a great opportunity to learn more about JavaScript and OOP.",
