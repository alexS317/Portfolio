      "I designed and developed this Android app together with a study colleague in the context of our end project for the third semester. In this app, users can upload images of their favourite fictional characters, and then get randomised positive affirmations from those characters, to help with feelings like stress and anxiety. I was responsible for the main part of the programming. It is simple, but fulfils it purpose perfectly, and we were very happy with it.",

  //     "For a group project that was essentially about microcontrollers, my team members and I decided that we wanted to make an interactive magic wand, that can detect motion and lights up when it is being swung around. I was responsible for creating the 3D model in Blender. Since it was a model made for a 3D print, texture painting would not have been necessary, however I tried it just for fun with a really quick and simple texture that I created. It could serve as a concept for painting the real-life print.",

  //     "For the final project of my course on mobile coding in the 3rd semester, I decided to make a simple to-do-list app. We worked with Kotlin, which was completely new for me, but I ended up having much more fun with it than I thought I would. At times it was a bit overwhelming, and I could not do everything in the given time frame that I would have wanted to do (for example some changes in the design), but it works just like intended, and I am very happy to have now a small app made by myself.",

      "A simple website for sharing art, which I created in the second semester in context of my two-week end project. It was developed by using Node.js and a MySQL database. Users can sign up and log in, edit or delete their profiles, as well as post and delete pictures. Everything (including the example drawings) is made by me. I learned a lot about client- and server-side development through this project, and would like to show it directly, but due to connection problems with the hosting service and the database provided to us, it is no longer possible.",

I kept the graphics rather simple due to time limitation, but it was a great opportunity to learn more about JavaScript and OOP.",
