      <h1>Alexandra Fontner</h1>
      <h3>Aspiring Developer & Digital Artist</h3>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my page, I am happy you found your way here! My
        name is Alexandra, I am a young Austrian student currently on the way to
        get my BSc in Creative Computing. I am interested in various kinds of
        digital technologies, like software development (particularly for games,
        but also web and mobile), 3D art and animation, or visual effects, and
        would love to work in one of those fields in the future. On this page
        here you can find some information about me and my work.
      </p>

    <h3>Skills and Tools I am interested in/would like to learn more about</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
      Unfortunately, my university curriculum cannot include everything that I
      want to learn, but I am trying to get familiar with at least some of them
      via self-study. I have listed a few things here that I am currently in the
      progress of learning or plan to learn soon (words written in
      <i>italics</i> are technologies that I will still get to know in my study
      programme).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unreal Engine</li>
      <li><i>Unity</i></li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li><i>C#</i></li>
      <li>
        Various common 3D programs for modelling, sculpting, texturing and
        animation (e.g. <i>Maya</i>, ZBrush, Substance Painter)
      </li>
      <li>Other programs from the Adobe Suite (e.g. <i>After Effects</i>)</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>
        ... and probably more, as I am generally open and excited towards
        learning new things :)
